## About Angular
[AngularJS](https://angularjs.org) is a JavaScript-based open-source front-end web framework mainly maintained by Google and by a community of individuals and corporations to address many of the challenges encountered in developing single-page applications.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.0.0-next.3.

## Quick start ðŸš€

1.  **Install packages.**

    Navigate into your new siteâ€™s directory and install the packages with either:

    ```bash
    # Install packages with NPM
    npm install
    ```

    or

    ```
    # Install packages with Yarn
    yarn install
    ```

1.  **Start developing.**

    Run the development server:

    Run `ng serve` for a dev server (alternatively `npm run start` or `yarn run start`). Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

    
## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
